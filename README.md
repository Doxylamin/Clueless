# Installation

I would prefer that you do not run an instance of this bot. If you wish to use it, you can invite it to your own server or join the support server linked above.

## Requirements

- python3 [(version 3.9.5 recommended)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/)
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
## 1) Register your bot on discord

- See the [discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) on how to create an application and a bot.

- Make sure both `bot` and `application.commands` scopes are selected.

- Put your tokens in a `.env` file following the template in [.env.dist](.env.dist)

## 2) Install the required dependencies

    $ poetry install


## 3) Start the bot

    $ poetry run python src/main.py

# Deploy on a distant host (with pm2)

## Install pm2  

You need to install pm2 on your local machine and on the host:
- install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- `npm install pm2 -g`
- check installation with `pm2 -v`  

## Setup
Edit [`ecosystem.sample.js`](ecosystem.sample.js) with your host information and rename it to `ecosystem.config.js`

On your local machine:

    pm2 deploy production setup

## Deploy

    pm2 deploy production

If you get an error, make sure to update your `.env` information on the host too.

For more information, see [this deploy pm2 guide](https://gist.github.com/hoangmirs/b2cb60e0aa60019f0c8b13927ce9d0a2).
